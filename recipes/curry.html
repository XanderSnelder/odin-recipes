    <h4>Takumi Ramen Kitchen</h4>
    <p>This Japanese Chicken Katsu Curry Rice is our new favorite recipe of the moment! 
        It's a symphony of texturesâ€”crispy panko-breaded chicken cutlet, creamy curry sauce, and slightly sticky, beautifully translucent Japanese rice. What more could you ask from a meal? </p>

            <li>1 package (220g) S&B golden curry (or Vermont curry, Java curry)</li>
            <li>Scallions, sliced</li>
            <li>2 tbsp (28g) unsalted butter</li>

    </p>

    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Slice the onions as thinly as you can. Roughly chop the carrot and potatoes.</li>
            <li>In a pot, heat the oil (3 tbsp) over medium heat. Once it gets nice and hot, add the onions and saute for 40 minutes or until deep caramelized. </li>
            <li>Meanwhile, in another wok (or pan), heat the oil (1 tbsp) over medium heat. Once that's hot, add the carrot and potatoes. Cook for 10 minutes or until golden brown. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Once the onions are deep caramelized, add the tomato paste and cumin powder. Stir together for 1 minute. Add 8 cups (1,920ml) water, chicken bouillon powder, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, potatoes, and carrot. Stir to combine. Simmer, covered, for 30 minutes over medium-low heat. </li>
            <li>Remove from the heat. Add the curry roux and unsalted butter. Stir until it's well combined. Using an immersion blender, blend until it's nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>Put it on a gentle heat. Once it's back up to a boil, set aside and keep warm until ready to serve.</li>
        </ol>
